Abstractâ€” Cardiovascular diseases have been one of the leading causes of death globally, where around 17.9 million deaths are recorded every year,
and these numbers are increasing. With the number of factors causing heart disease being high, it is challenging for a doctor or a practitioner to diagnose
if a person has heart failure or not. Data mining helps extract useful information from the data collected by the medical industry. The extracted information helps make decisions. This study analyses the dataset from the Kaggle platform, and the study aims to find effective data mining techniques that could help predict a patient's heart failure. The purpose of the study is to predict heart failure by employing different ensemble models, namely RandomForest, Adaboost, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, XG Boost, and Voting classifiers. Furthermore, the ensemble models are evaluated based on various classification metrics like precision, recall, F1_Score and the ROC-AUC curve. Experimental results demonstrate that the random forest classifier performs better than other models with an accuracy of 87.5%, and F1 score of 89.2% and a ROC AUC value of 0.926. Integrating the ensemble model with the health care systems could help predict heart failure immediately when live data are collected from patients.
